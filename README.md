# Completeness function to determine and increase the probability of detecting transits for Jupyter (IPython Notebook)

To find exoplanet systems, most people assume that we can detect any orbital period with the same probability (module some geometric effects). This works well for space-based observations, and for ground-based observatories collecting data from 100s of thousands of stars. However, surveys involving fewer stars may miss planets whose orbital period are close to integer number of days (or integer ratios).

See the source folder to find the Jupyter Notebook which contains various pre-defined functions altogether used to investigate the detection probabilities of different exoplanet orbital periods around a particular host star by executing Monte-Carlo simulations.
